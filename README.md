# Forkify

Welcome to Forkify, a recipe application that allows you to discover, save, and explore a wide range of delicious recipes. This project was developed by me under the guidance of Jonas Schemtmann, an instructor at Udemy. Forkify is designed to be user-friendly, intuitive, and efficient. It does not utilize a database and instead relies on APIs to fetch and store recipe data.

## Features

- **Add Recipe**: Create and save your own recipes in the application. Enter the necessary details such as the recipe title, ingredients, cooking time, and instructions.

- **Bookmark Recipe**: Bookmark recipes you want to save for future reference. This feature allows you to quickly access your favorite recipes.

- **Show Individual Recipe**: View detailed information about a specific recipe, including ingredients, preparation steps, cooking time, and nutritional information.

- **Pagination**: The application supports pagination to display recipes in a structured and organized manner. You can navigate through multiple pages to explore a wide variety of recipes.

- **Fetching Recipes from API**: Forkify fetches recipe data from external APIs, ensuring you have access to a vast collection of recipes. The application integrates with popular recipe APIs to provide up-to-date and diverse recipe options.

- **Search Recipe**: Effortlessly search for recipes based on keywords, ingredients, or categories. The search feature enables you to find specific recipes that match your preferences or dietary needs.
